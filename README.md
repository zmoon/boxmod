## Notes

* `boxmod` was initially developed during the [2020 HU PBL Workshop](https://dnwsite.weebly.com/pbl-workshop-2020.html)
* The box model formulation is based on that described in the [KPP](https://people.cs.vt.edu/asandu/Software/Kpp/) paper (doi:[10.1016/S0098-1354(02)00128-X](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0098-1354(02)00128-X))
* The mechanism analysis tools are in some cases inspired by [barronh/permm](https://github.com/barronh/permm)
